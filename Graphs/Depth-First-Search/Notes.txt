Depth first search is a recursive algorithm that traverses a tree in a depth-first fashion.i.e. It starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

sometimes there might have cycles(circular loop connections) in the graph.Then we use a visited field to know if a field is visited or not to avoid infinite loop.

example:
              A
            / | \
           B  C  D
          / \    / \
          E  F   G  H
            / \   \
            I  J   K

output: [A,B,E,F,I,J,C,D,G,K,H]
