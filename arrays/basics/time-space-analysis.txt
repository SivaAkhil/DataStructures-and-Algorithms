Arrays:-
arrays are two types,
1. Static Arrays
2. Dynamic Arrays

T: time complexicity
S: space complexicity

intializing array: O(n) T,S
traversing: O(n) T , O(1) S   (traversing means looping through array)
getting an element: O(1) T,S
setting an element: O(1) T,S (overwriting an array)
copying array: O(n) T,S
inseting an element: O(n) T, O(1) S
by amortizing analysis inseting element in dynamic arrays at end is O(1) T
in beggining is O(n) T
